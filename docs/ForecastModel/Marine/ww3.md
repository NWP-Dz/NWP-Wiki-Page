# Forecast Model 

## Wave Watch III

WAVEWATCH III is a numerical model that calculates the evolution of wave action. It is based on a spectral (Fourier) decomposition of the sea state . This software is developed by an international team around NOAA/NCEP. This code computes the evolution of waves in space and time and has been applied at all scales from the global ocean to the beach.
